Andre Saramago CV

This project is an online CV for someone who works IT but in an area that doesn't work with the kind of projects that could be possible to put in a portfolio. Either way, we've 
(me and Andre - the guy on the resume) thought that this could be a good way to stand out from other professionals in the same IT area and help him with his current goal of changing jobs.

I wanted to do something with a clean, modern and simple look, not too much out of the box but different enough from the other virtualization professionals. This description was given to me
by Andre when he explain to me what he needed in an online CV. He says this is the description of this particular IT area (and from what I could gather from my research, I agree) so I wanted to
match it.

UX

I believe the website is intuitive and easy to navigate. Has the necessary information for a first assesment but doesn't have too much information where the visitor/recruiter/user could lose him/herself but the option to dowload the complete and more
traditional version of the CV provides more info if necessary. Also, the contacts always visible on the footer gives the visitor/recruiter/user and easy way to contact Andre and obtain whatever
more information needed. Also includes a link for the LinkedIn page with more info.

Even tought I decided to make some changes of layout during the project, the initial mockups and ideas can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/c2c7pkk6iinvkna/AABOXc-ZhWJF2rYOQzEXGT-Ca?dl=0

I made some research online to get inspired, this one in particular:

I used the following website for picking the colours:

Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

Features Left to Implement
Another feature idea
Technologies Used
In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.
Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
