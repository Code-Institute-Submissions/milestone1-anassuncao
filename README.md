**ANDRE SARAMAGO CV**

This project is an online CV for someone who works IT but in an area that doesn't work with the kind of projects that could be possible to put in a portfolio. Either way, we've 
(me and Andre - the guy on the resume) thought that this could be a good way to stand out from other professionals in the same IT area and help him with his current goal of changing jobs.

I wanted to do something with a clean, modern and simple look, not too much out of the box but different enough from the other virtualization professionals. This description was given to me
by Andre when he explain to me what he needed in an online CV. He says this is the description of this particular IT area (and from what I could gather from my research, I agree) so I wanted to
match it.


**UX**

I believe the website is intuitive and easy to navigate. Has the necessary information for a first assesment but doesn't have too much information where the visitor/recruiter/user could lose him/herself but the option to dowload the complete and more
traditional version of the CV provides more info if necessary. Also, the contacts always visible on the footer gives the visitor/recruiter/user and easy way to contact Andre and obtain whatever
more information needed. Also includes a link for the LinkedIn page with more info.

Even tought I decided to make some changes of layout during the project, the initial mockups and ideas can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/c2c7pkk6iinvkna/AABOXc-ZhWJF2rYOQzEXGT-Ca?dl=0


**FEATURES**

The About Me page is the landing page where the user can get to know the professional imediatly. It has his picture, a small text about his experiencie (kinds of companies where he worked and kind of
tasks/functions that he has done) and his language skills.
The header and the footer are present through all the pages of the website and allow the user to always have access to the professional contacts (phone and email) and to his profession. The footer
also provides the link to the LinkedIn page and the possibility to download a resume in Europass format.

The resume page provides a timeline of the work experience with dates, roles and companies information. For more detailed info the user can also access to the LinkedIn page or download the CV.

The skills page has information about the most relevant technical skills and soft/behavioural skills. Again, for more detailed information (especialy about the technologies knowledge), the user
can download the CV or explore the LinkedIn page, or even contact directly with the professional.


**TECHNOLOGIES USED**

I used Bootstrap documentation for the grid, responsiveness, navbar, progress bar, between others:
https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/getting-started/introduction/

The icons used through out the webiste come from Font Awesome:
https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery

I've used the Google Fonts Noto Sans JP and PT Sans: 
https://fonts.google.com/



**TESTING**

I used the following for validating the html and css code.

CSS validation in https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator came out with no errors.

HTML validation in https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea came out with one div that wasn't properly closed. Resume page came out with no errors and skills page had one extra closing div. 
After fixing it, everything became correct.

Also used the devtools of Chrome to test the responsiveness in all the available models of cellphones and tablets.
